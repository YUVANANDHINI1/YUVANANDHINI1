## FaceFusion
FaceFusion is an AI-powered tool that delivers high-quality face enhancements and realistic face swaps. Using models like GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN, and InsightFace, it has it application
in/with film studios, content creators, and designers seeking efficient and affordable visual effects.

## SIH 2023 Project - Deep Learning for Terrain Recognition
This project aims to deploy a software where users can upload an image to identify the type of terrain and its implicit quantity. It uses Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to perform terrain recognition. This application is beneficial for navigating self-driving military vehicles to find the safest and most efficient routes.

## Object Detection
The goal of this project is to employ the YOLO object detection method to identify objects in an image. Detected objects are visually highlighted by drawing bounding boxes and labeling them, enabling easy interpretation and interaction with the detection results.

## Virtual Mouse
This project uses computer vision to track the movements of the user, functioning as a virtual mouse. Machine Learning algorithms are utilized to improve its accuracy over time.
# Achievements üèÜ
## Finalist, Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023
Selected as one of 5 finalist teams in the problem statement on "Deep Learning for Terrain Recognition" among over 50,000 ideas from 44,000 teams. The grand finale featured more than 12,000 participants and 2,500 mentors across 48 nodal centers. Being among the finalists in such a competitive environment is a testament to my skills and innovative approach to problem-solving.
