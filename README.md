# Projects
## SIH 2023 Project - Deep Learning for Terrain Recognition
This project aims to deploy a software where users can upload an image to identify the type of terrain and its implicit quantity. It uses Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to perform terrain recognition. This application is beneficial for navigating self-driving military vehicles to find the safest and most efficient routes.

## Object Detection
The goal of this project is to employ the YOLO object detection method to identify objects in an image. Detected objects are visually highlighted by drawing bounding boxes and labeling them, enabling easy interpretation and interaction with the detection results.

## Virtual Mouse
This project uses computer vision to track the movements of the user, functioning as a virtual mouse. Machine Learning algorithms are utilized to improve its accuracy over time.
